## LINQ - Language Integrated Query ##


# It is a set of technologies based on the integration of query functionalities directly into the C# language

-> Operations called directly from collections
-> Queries are first-class objects
-> IDE Compiler and IntelliSense Support
-> Namespace System.LINQ;
-> It has several query operations, whose parameters are typically lambda expressions or expressions with a syntax similar to SQL

-> Define the query
-> Execute the query (foreach or some terminal operation)
